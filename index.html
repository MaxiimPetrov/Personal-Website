            <p>Divine Retribution 8-bit Project</p>
          </div>
          <div class="project-details">
            <p>Here is a video game project I made alongside two good friends of mine within the Godot game engine. The game is a 2D retro platformer that is meant to imitate 1986's Castlevania from the NES. Everything from the artwork to the movement was meant to replicate the feel of the original Castlevania. This was the first project I made completly from the ground up. It was an arduous process, and its by no means perfect, but it was worth the effort. More screenshots from the game can be viewed <a class="link" href="divine_retribution_screenshots.html">here</a> and can be downloaded <a class="link" href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/9h10c4oiwdsckcksmgiyr/Divine-Retribution-8-bit-Project.exe?rlkey=tz9elzul1s1ythg46l8iclnc3&st=4wrfvpmk&dl=0">here</a></p>

            Soulslike Platformer Project

          <div class="project-details-flipped">
            <p>This is my second video game project that I made in the Godot game engine, grabbing assets and sounds from itch.io. This is another 2D platformer and for this project I tried improving upon some of the shortcomings of the Castlevania style that was replicated in the first project, trying to make the movement and combat feel more fluid. I also tried to delve into making more complex enemy AI as well as utilize more features of the engine, like incorporating a parallax background and screen shake.

            <p>Retro FPS Project</p>
          </div>
          <div class="project-details">
            <p>This is my third video game project that I made in unreal engine 5 using its blueprints system. This is a retro fps that is meant to imitate the original DOOM. This was my first time stepping outside of the Godot engine which I have grown accustomed to, and though it was daunting to learn an entirely new engine, seeing how other engines outside of Godot operate was a valuable experience.

            SFML Pong Project
          </div>
          <div class="project-details-flipped">
            <p>This is a game project where I wanted to step outside of using one of the big game engines out there like I did previously. It's just a simple game of pong made using C++ and the SFML library. I wanted to get a better understanding of how certain game mechanisms work from the ground up such as collisions, and get past some of the abstraction the game engines I used in the past provided.

            <p>Mega Man Platformer Project</p>

          <div class="project-details">
            <p>This is my second project made using unreal engine 5. It is a 2D platformer with similar mechanics to that of the original mega man games. At this point I have grown more used to working with unreal engine and its visual scripting system "Blueprints". But overall it was interesting to go through the process of creating a 2D game within a 3D environment, and seeing first hand how other games I have played in the past used a 3D environment withing 2D perspectives.
